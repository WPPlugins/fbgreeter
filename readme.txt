== Description ==

(See also: http://axiom7.com/?p=101)

FBgreeter is a WordPress plugin designed to open up your blog to more
than 500 million Facebook users.

To set up FBgreeter on your blog, you will need to:

1. Create a Facebook account, if you don't already have one.
1. Create a Facebook application for your blog.
1. Take note of your Application ID and Application Secret.
1. Download and install the FBgreeter plugin.
1. Enter your Application ID and Application Secret on the Settings
  page of FBgreeter.
1. Drag the FBgreeter widget to a sidebar.

These steps should take about 15 minutes.

Once you are done, you will benefit from FBgreeter in the following
manner:

1. Facebook users will be able to log in to your blog using their
Facebook account. This will allow them to comment and participate
in other social features your blog may offer without having to go
through the process of creating yet another user account.
1. The first time a Facebook user logs in to your blog using their
Facebook account, FBgreeter will attempt to import their Facebook
account in order to create a WordPress account automatically. This
will allow you to keep track of your audience and it will allow
your readers to log in to your blog without logging in to
Facebook.
1. If FBgreeter creates a WordPress account on behalf of a Facebook
user, FBgreeter will send a welcome message to that user with
their login credentials.
1. All WordPress accounts created by FBgreeter will have the
"Subscriber" role. Therefore, Facebook users will be able to
manage their profile, read and write comments, receive
newsletters, etc. No administrative, editorial or authoring rights
will be granted ; you will keep full control of your blog.

1. Unzip fbgreeter.zip.
